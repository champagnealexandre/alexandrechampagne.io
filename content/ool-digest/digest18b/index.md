title: OoL digest — July 25th edition (PART 2)
subtitle: "Here is part two of this week’s digest. In the field of biochemistry, Dudin looked at the interplay between the sedimentation rate and the evolution of multicellularity, Podolsky published a Review of synthetic cell compartments, Trapp analyzed salt-induced peptide formation in early-Earth analogue conditions, Vidiella presents a gene network displaying self-organized critical behavior and Zamani-Dahaj examines the relationship between the emergence of heritability and the evolution of multicellularity. Finally, in mathematical biology Koduri analyzes how natural selection can favor cooperation. Happy reading !!"

title: OoL digest — edition 15
subtitle: In this week’s digest, we have papers from several areas of OoL research. In biochemistry, Lennon analyzes a synthetically constructed minimal cell and Tupper examines non-enzymatic possibilities for RNA replication. In evolutionary biology, Olejarz looks at the evolutionary dynamics of the GOE. In paraeontology, Yang report the discovery of a fossil deposit from the Cambrian. Finally, in planetary science Hallsworth discusses the role of water activity in Venus’s clouds, McGeoch examines the presence of amino acids in meteorites, Seager analyzes the possibility of atmospheric life in sub-Neptune worlds, and Seales models the temporal evolution of the habitable zone for Earth-like exoplanets. Happy reading !

title: OoL digest — October 31th edition
subtitle: "In this week’s digest, we have papers published in both astrobiology and biochemistry -- plus I’ve included a podcast of the Santa Fe Institute. In astrobiology, Dorn presents an interior model for water-rich rocky exoplanets, Green discusses best practices for communicating about life detection, Hu discusses observables to discriminate small H$_2$ atmospheres and massive ones on sub-Neptunes (with implications for habitability) using JWST, and Grefenstette discusses the different strategies for finding life in space. In biochemistry, Cowan discusses the origin of chirality from the viewpoint of the RNA world hypothesis, Sharma reviews prebiotic chemical reaction networks modelling tools, and Takeuchi discusses the balance between within- and among-collectives in population genetics models. Happy reading!"

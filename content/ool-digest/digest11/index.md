title: OoL digest — edition 11
subtitle: Time for a new OoL digest! This week we have stuff on astrobiology, biochemistry and information theory. In the astrobiology department, Yasui analyzes how impact heating influences organic material formation in asteroids, Famiano suggests a model for the origin of homochirality of amino acids in meteorites, Rosenthal presents the results of the California Legacy Survey on exoplanets around FGKM stars, Paradise analyzes the correlations between simulated exoplanet atmosphere spectra and the presence of liquid water on the surface, and Patty suggests spectropolarimetry as a way to detect alien life. In biochemistry, Guo suggests liquid-liquid non-associative phase separation as a possible compartmentalization mechanism, and Smith discusses the ambiguities between the biotic and the abiotic at the origin of life. Finally, I’ve included a podcast in which Sara I. Walker discusses the information theory of the origin of life. Happy reading!

title: OoL digest — edition 13
subtitle: In this weeks OoL digest, we have several articles on biosignatures, plus some discussions of thermodynamics’s role in life processes, climate regulation and planetary formation. In the field of astrobiology, we have an article by Barge and collaborators that report measurements suggesting Enceladus could support methanogenesis, Cross presents new modelling data of molecules identified as biosignatures and Patty discusses advances on remotely detecting chirality. In the biophysics category, I’ve included this week’s Complexity podcasts, where Mark Ritchie talks about cell thermodynamics. Finally, in planetary science Marlow analyzes the role of deep sea microbial populations in temperature regulation on Earth, and Paneque-Carreño reports advances about the gravitational instability hypothesis of planetary formation. Happy reading !!

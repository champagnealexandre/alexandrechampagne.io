title: OoL digest — edition 1
subtitle: This is the OoL digest, first edition! Today, we have two articles in astrophysics that discuss the formation of water in planetary systems and the possibility of a Marsian origin of life, two articles in biology that analyze the catalytic role of minerals in RNA formation and propose a 2-domain tree of life, and an article in information theory comparing the information content of living and non-living systems displaying collective behavior.

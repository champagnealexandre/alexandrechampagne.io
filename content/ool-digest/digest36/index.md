title: OoL digest â€” December 7th edition
subtitle: "Seven new articles this week. In astrobiology, we have a preprint on phosphine production on Venus (Bains), a review of key observations and outstanding questions on Mars exploration (Changela) and a report of deposits suggesting fleeting water on Mars (Koeppel). In biochemistry, Closs presents a class of organocatalysts potentially capable of forming an evolutionary system, Ianeselli discusses how gas bubbles in rock pores could have been a nursery for life on early Earth and Piedrafita analyzes how cysteine and iron could have facilitated the first evolving metabolic networks. Finally, in planetary sciences Wade investigates planetary how iron can influence planetary habitability and initiation of biochemistry from geochemistry. Happy reading!"

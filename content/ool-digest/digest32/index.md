subtitle: "Several papers this week from astrobiology, biochemistry and geophysics.

<br> <br> 

Astrobiology: Cheng examines salt sediments in a Mars analogue environment in China, Jarugula reports the detection of H$_2$O in a galaxy at $z=6.9$, Millan reports the detection of organic molecules on Mars by Curiosity, and Patapis examines the feasibility of applying molecular mapping of directly imaged exoplanets to JWST’s Medium Resolution Spectrometer.

Biochemistry: Jamy analyzes the rate of habitat transition in eukaryotes, Mayer the transamination between biological keto and amino acids through metal ions, and McMullen discusses how colloids can self-organize into predetermined structures.

Geophysics: Drake presents a thermochronological perspective on the habitability of Earth's Precambrian cratons through time, Pohl explores the Late Ordovician mass extinction, and Putman examines the roles that both selection and dispersal limitation play in terrestrial serpentinites.

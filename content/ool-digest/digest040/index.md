title: OoL digest — January 11th edition
subtitle: "Big week in ool research: we have eight papers in astrobiology, biochemistry and planetary science. In astrobiology, Franz discusses the Breakthrough Listen Initiative -- a technosignature search for TESS TOIs, Fujiya reports the radiometric age of a C-complex asteroid with implications on their occurrence, Pearce presents a chemical model of early Earth atmosphere and discusses the rain-out of HCN and its implications for the warm little ponds hypothesis, and Svensmark discusses supernovae frequency and distribution of organic matter. In biochemistry Pan reviews the relevance of viruses for ool scenarios and Heili reports experiments on cellular export of functional protein and RNA products. Finally, in planetary science Slotznick reexamines a transient pre-GEO oxygenation event and Cooke uses a three-dimensional chemistry-climate model to simulate changes in $O_3$ since the GOE, with implications for terrestrial habitability. Enjoy!"

title: OoL digest — edition 7
subtitle: Greetings from Montreal! Today we again have a lot of papers related to the OoL. In biochemistry, Jia examines the segregation of RNA in microdroplets, Li the role of hydrophobic-cationic peptides in wet-dry cycles, and Yagi the role that double-psi beta-barrel could have played in the early genetic code. In astrobiology, Davila looks at possible transfer scenarios between Mars and the Earth and Liu discusses the hypothesis of a reducing atmosphere on early Mars. Kaltenegger and Krissansen‐Totton both discuss biosignature observation, Turbet looks at the influence of the host star’s spectral properties on planetary habitability and Yang analyzes the reasons why the amounts of organic material differ through planet formation processes. Happy reading!

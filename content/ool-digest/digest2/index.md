title: OoL digest — edition 2
subtitle: Alright, it’s already time for our second OoL digest! Today, we have one article in Earth Sciences discussing the detection of organic molecules from 3.5 billion years ago, and five others in biochemistry/biology about autocatalytic networks, evolution of replication, protein homochirality, scaling laws and in situ testing of theories on the origin of life. Happy reading!

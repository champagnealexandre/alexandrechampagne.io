title: OoL digest — edition 8
subtitle: Today we have a smaller, but more diversified digest -- Fisher demonstrates how multivariate analysis and metabolic networks can be useful to derive exoplanet properties, Tarnas looked at the chemical composition of Martian meteorites to see if radiolysis-driven habitats could exist on Mars, Steffens discusses the role of the reverse TCA cycle in hydrothermal vents ecology, Atzori analyzes the interaction between chiral materials and light under magnetic fields, and Herrmann discusses the reasons that might explain why the emergence of cyanobacteria did not immediately lead to the GOE.

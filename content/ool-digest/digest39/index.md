title: OoL digest â€” January 3rd edition
subtitle: "First ool-digest edition of 2022: we have two papers in astrobiology, two in biochemistry and one in computational biology. In astrobiology, Coelho presents a spectra catalogue of life in ice to facilitate the search for biosignatures and Raymond-Bouchard discusses sequencing with the MinION instrument as a way to detect microbial biosignatures. In biochemistry, Mizuuchi discusses recent approaches to develop a replication system capable of Darwinian evolution and Yukawa suggests that the RNA-DNA transition could have been easier than previously thought. Finally, in computational biology Bonforti presents a model of cell-cell adhesion addressing the problem of how multicellularity could have emerged. Happy reading!"

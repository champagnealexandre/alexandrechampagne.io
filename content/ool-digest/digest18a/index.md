title: OoL digest — July 25th edition (PART 1)
subtitle: "So much research published this week that I decided to split the digest in two parts. Today, we have several papers in the field of astrobiology: Bains presents another reanalysis of phosphine as a biosignature on Venus, and Cable reports on Titan’s organic chemistry chemistry and mineralogy, highlighting future research avenues, anticipating on NASA’s *Dragonfly* mission in the coming decade. Jahmidi-Azizi examines protein-ligand interactions in conditions analogue to Mars’s, and Paradise presents ExoPlaSim, a Global Climate Model extension of the original PlaSim that is designed to be applicable to a wider range of planetary conditions. Finally, in systems biology we have a paper by Brunk presenting a set of simple criteria for evaluating OoL scenarios. Happy reading !!"

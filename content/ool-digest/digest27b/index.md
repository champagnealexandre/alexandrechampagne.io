title: OoL digest — September 28th edition, part two
subtitle: "Part two of this week’s digest, today we have papers in biochemistry & geophysics. In biochemistry, we first have a paper by Akbari that suggests a model of electroneutrality as a mean to elevate the concentrations of organic intermediates in early protocells. The second paper by Kahana examines the experimental evidence that lipid aggregates could have possessed the required configuration to seed life’s origin. The third paper, by Liu, explores prebiotic chemistry, gene sequences, plasticizers and opiates through molecular assembly. In the fourth paper, Matsuo investigates the conditions suitable for concurrent peptide generation and self-assembly. In geophysics, I’ve first included an interesting article from Scientific American that discusses the implications of Gan’s paper, published in January, on fungus-like fossils having contributed to making Earth habitable. The second paper by Gilabert suggests that volcanism did not cause the massive extinction of species in the late Cretaceous. The third paper, by Sánchez-García, examines the use of biomarkers through a multianalytical platform combining lipid-derived biomarkers, metaproteomics and a so-called 'life-detector chip'. Finally, the fourth paper by Selensky investigates the possibility of deep subsurface biospheres fueled by in situ chemolithoautothophy. Happy reading !"

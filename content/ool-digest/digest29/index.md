title: OoL digest — October 19th edition
subtitle: "Again quite a busy week, with fourteen articles in astrobiology, biochemistry and geophysics. The first article in astrobiology, by Brandenburg, investigates the various ways in which chirality enters astrophysics. Chou examines the agnostic life detection possibilities using mass spectrometry. Another article on chirality, by Globus, discusses how muon decay could have induced a biological preference for one type of chirality. Kruijver investigates the habitability of massive Earth-like exoplanets using a thermal evolution model and a model of carbon cycle, while Macdonald examines how planetary surface conditions affect climate and habitability using the ExoPlaSim GCM. Ranjan discusses UV transmission on early Earth, and Ryan applies PCA statistical learning to exoplanet ocean detection. Finally, Shen examines nitrogen cycling and biosignature detection in a Mars analog environment while Turbet questions the presence of oceans on early Venus using GCMs. In biochemistry, the first article by Abbas investigates the role of LLPS, and specifically that of a short peptide synthon, in protocell formation. Guo also examines phase separation, presenting a prebiotically plausible pathway for non-associative phase separation. Jordan discusses FeS cluster formation with cysteine, and Pinna the conservation across life and prebiotic character of ATP. Finally, the last article, in geophysics, Stockey suggests that oxygenation exerts a first-order control on (simulated) extinction vulnerability of marine animals, with implications in extinction control through geologic time. Happy reading !!"

title: OoL digest — edition 10
subtitle: In today’s digest we have several articles about biosignatures/astrochemistry. There are discussions of panspermia detectability, spectrum of chiral molecules and confirmed detection of phospholipids in the interstellar medium. We also have two articles about the identification of new biosignatures from assembly theory and stoichiometry. Moreover, we have a paper about the influence of synergestic coevolution on the rate of molecular evolution and another one discussing oxygen’s role in the development of multicellularity. Finally, we have an article about the expected number of autocatalytic sets in chemical systems. Happy reading!

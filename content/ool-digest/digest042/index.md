title: OoL digest — January 25th edition
subtitle: "This week, 16 articles were published on the ool in astrobiology, biochemistry, biophysics and planetary science. In astrobiology, we have papers on biosignatures (Goodwin), organic molecules in the ISM (Guelin), Raman spectroscopy on CanMars (Lalla), the impact of photochemical runaway on biosignatures (Ranjan), ocean stability on ancient Mars, the panspermia hypothesis (Sithamparam) and an in situ microbial detection system (Touchette). In biochemistry we have papers on prebiotic organocatalysts (Closs), lipid membranes and RNA interactions (Czerniak), host-parasite molecular replication networks (Kamiura), viroids (Lee) and simulations of a minimal cell (Thornburg). In biophysics, we have a paper on self-organized emergence of behavior (Fleig) and in planetary science. Finally, in planetary science we have papers on impacts on early Earth (Citron), $O_2$ increase in the Archean (Leong) and an Earth-system biogeochemical model (Cole). Enjoy! "

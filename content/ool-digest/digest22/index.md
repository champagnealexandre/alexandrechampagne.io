title: OoL digest — August 22nd edition
subtitle: "Good afternoon! This week in OoL, three astrobiology preprints/papers: an addendum to the phosphine debate by Greaves, a review of biosignatures by Rimmer and a discussion of Early Earth habitability by Rivera-Valentin. In biology, we have an analysis of early life form morphologies by Kanaparthi, and a discussion on the multiple pathways to life hypothesis by Kempes. Happy reading!"

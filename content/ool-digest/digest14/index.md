title: OoL digest — edition 14
subtitle: Time for a new edition of the Origin of Life digest! This week we have several articles in the subfield of astrobiology. In the first paper by Covone, we have an analysis of the hypothetical photosynthesis process around known exoplanets. Published in *Nature*, Kaltenegger evaluated which of those exoplanets could see Earth as a transiting exoplanet. We also have a paper taking a look at the habitability of red dwarfs, and the corresponding paradox according to which given their ubiquity we *should* be around one of them. On arXiv a preprint was submitted by Manna et al. reporting the detection of glycine in the ISM by the ALMA observatory. Finally, I’ve included this week’s SFI podcast *Alien Crash Site* featuring an interview with Cole Mathis where he discusses his recent research on assembly theory and biosignatures. Happy reading !!

title: OoL digest — December 21st edition
subtitle: "Seven papers this week in OoL research ; four in astrobiology and three in biochemistry. In astrobiology, Bains presents a model according to which some gases in Venusian clouds would be biogenic, Barge discusses the threshold between abiotic and biotic sources for biosignatures, DePasquale suggests that Mars’ missing water might be stored in a clay mineral, and Paschek models nucleobase concentrations in planetesimals of carbonaceous chondrites. In biochemistry, Ding suggests that more uniform binding and reactivity of imidazolium-bridged intermediates may lead to the ability to copy arbitrary template sequences under prebiotically plausible conditions, Henriques Pereira discusses the role of geochemical protoenzymes in primordial metabolism, and Joshi analyzes the potential of N-acyl amino acids as a plausible niche for the emergence of cellular life on the early Earth. Enjoy!"

title: OoL digest — September 19th edition
subtitle: "In this week’s OoL research, we have an article in the field of astrobiology from Oberg that presents the results of a chemical composition mapping of five young stars with the ALMA observatory, including organic molecules like nitriles, relevant for the OoL. In biochemistry, Maguire reports on a probiotic system incorporating an orthophosphate cycle that could have been part of the first metabolism on Earth, Johnson-Finn presents hydrothermal experiments suggesting minerals can enhance the complexity of organic product pathways for carboxylic acids,	Sarkar reports experiments on wet-dry cycling and its effect on membrane formation/encapsulation, Walton presents a new 'scum' hypothesis aiming to overcome the instability of prebiotic membranes, Samulewski analyzes the interaction between ferrocyanide and minerals, concluding that the former may have been a source of cyanide on the primitive Earth, and Higgs proposes a set of three criteria for a set of chemical reactions to form a metabolism. Finally, we have an article in biology from Leslie that examines the evolution of complexity in plants, which would have occurred in two separate moments. Happy reading !"

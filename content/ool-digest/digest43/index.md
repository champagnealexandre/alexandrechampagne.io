title: OoL digest — January 31st edition
subtitle: "This week, there were 15 articles published on the origin of life in astrobiology, biochemistry, biophysics and microbiology. In astrobiology, we have papers on simulated habitability (Claudi), water detection on exoplanets with JWST (Ding), detection of basal reflections on Mars (Mattei) and a proposal for the DRAKE spectroscopy survey of M-dwarfs (Sarkar). In biochemistry, we have papers on polymerization of glycine and alanine (Baú), flocculation and dehydration (Cohen), DNA uptake (Kapteijn), cysteine encoding systems (Mukai), heredity in protocells (Palmeira), synthesis of aminoacyl-RNA (Roberts), storage of biochemical information (Schreiber) and CO$_2$ adsorption in FeS surfaces (Živković). In biophysics, we have a single article on non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the origin of life. Finally, in microbiology, we have a paper on Txikispora philomaios and the origin of multicellularity (Urrutia) and another one on microbial survival in extreme ecosystems (Wang). Enjoy!"

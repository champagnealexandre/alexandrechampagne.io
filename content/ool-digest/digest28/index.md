title: OoL digest — October 13th edition
subtitle: "After a little hiatus, here is a new edition of the OoL digest with eight new papers published (and more to come very soon!). We have papers in astrobiology, biochemistry and planetary science this week. The first paper, by Limaye, introduces a collection of papers on the venusian cloud layer from a workshop in Russia in 2019. In the second paper, McGuire presents a census of molecular species detected in the ISM. The third astrobiology paper by Mogul presents an analysis of the potential for phototrophy in venusian clouds. In biochemistry, the first paper from Carter discusses the emergence of genetic coding. The second paper, by Fournier, presents an estimate for when cyanobacteria and photosynthesis first originated. In the last two biochemistry papers Rubio-Sánchez analyzes membrane phase transitions while Tang investigates the transition to multicellularity in cyanobacteria. Finally, in planetary sciences Johnson examines through computer modeling how much oxygen might have been present pre-GOE on early Earth. Happy reading!"

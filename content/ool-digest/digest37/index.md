title: OoL digest — December 13th edition
subtitle: "This week in ool research we have three astrobiology papers, three in biochemistry and two in planetary science. In astrobiology, Seager presents a suite of mission concepts to study habitability on Venus, Tomita-Yokotani investigates cell survival during the Tanpopo ISS mission, and Yiğit discusses atmospheric escapes that affected Mars’ habitability. In biochemistry, Fraccia investigates light-responsive reactive coacervates as a route to the non-enzymatic synthesis of polynucleotides, Sauer discusses the formation of the peptide world on early Earth, and Wimmer analyzes the energetics of LUCA. Finally, in planetary science Havig analyzes the elemental composition of hot spring biocumulus, and Mojzsis discusses the ingredients of a rocky planet in the context of geoastronomy. Happy reading!"

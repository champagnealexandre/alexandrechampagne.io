title: OoL digest — July 18th edition
subtitle: "In this week’s OoL research, we have several new articles out. In astrobiology, Kotsyurbenko analyses the plausibility of Venusian clouds habitability, and Charlier suggests that the presence of strontium-84 on meteoritic material indicates an early accretion of water on Earth. In biochemistry, Ianeselli examines how gas bubbles in heated rock pores can induce the evolution of protocells, Ram analyses how the inheritance of mutation rates promotes adaptive evolution, and Cavalazzi presents the discovery of 3.42Gyrs old methanogens in volcanic substrates. Happy reading !!"

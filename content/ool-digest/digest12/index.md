title: OoL digest — edition 12
subtitle: Greetings from Montreal! A lot of amazing new research out this week -- and part of it comes from OoLEN members! First, I’ve included the current issue of the Santa Fe Institute podcast where Natalie Grefenstette talks about agnostic biosignature detection. In biochemistry, OoLEN members Silke Asche and Cole Mathis coauthored a paper on automating Origin of Life experiments and Tony Jia published one on compartmentalization. In biophysics, Akbari suggests a set of physico-chemical constraints for living systems, Dye looks at tissue self-organization in the Drosophila and Stolar analyzes mechanochemical peptide bond formation. Finally, in planetary science, Martin revisits water formation on Earth and Nibauer looks at the dependance of planetary systems on stellar chemical abundance patterns. Happy reading !!

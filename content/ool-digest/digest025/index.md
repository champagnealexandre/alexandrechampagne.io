title: OoL digest â€” September 12th edition
subtitle: "Quick one again this week: we have three articles, one in astrobiology and two in biology. The first one by Sarkar proposes a classification algorithm for planetary habitability from the point of view that Earth could be an anomaly. The second one, from Lindsey, is a phylotranscriptomics assessment of the volvocine algae suggesting multiple origins to cellular differenciation. Finally, we also have a preprint by Mizuuchi that examines the complexification of a RNA lineage into developing regulatory networks. Happy reading!"

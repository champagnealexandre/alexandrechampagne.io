title: OoL digest — September 28th edition, part one
subtitle: "This week’s digest contains many publications so it is divided into two parts, the second part will be published toworrow. Today I’ll be focusing on astrobiology papers. The first three papers by Turbet, Sergeev and Fauchez describe results from the TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison, which consist in GCM modeling of the TRAPPIST-1e spectroscopic features as seen by JWST, and subsequent habitability states. The fourth paper, by Gobat, studies the process of panspermia by modeling the probability of successful travel of organic compounds between stars with habitable planets. The fifth paper, by Höning, investigates the early habitability of Venus. The following paper by Kong reports machine learning applications on habitable planetary systems classification. We then have another paper, by Messmer this time, that applies statistical learning to discern spectral patterns of biosignatures through Raman spectroscopy. Finally, the two last papers examine PH$_3$ generation pathways on rocky planets (Omran) and the connection between the size of Mars and its limited habitability (Tian). Stay tuned for the second part!"

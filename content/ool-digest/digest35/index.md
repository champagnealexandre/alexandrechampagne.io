title: OoL digest — November 29nd edition
subtitle: "Several articles published in astrobiology this week, and one in planetary science. Articles in astrobiology include the (non-)detection of sulphur species in the Martian atmosphere (Braude), a study of cis-trans isomerization reactions of two astrophysically relevant acids (García De La Concepción), an investigation of biologically relevant abiotic extraterrestrial soluble organic matter (Isa), of the upper limits on TRAPPIST-1 planets bombardment histories (Raymond), a deep learning classifier for exoplanets (Valizadegan), derivation of a new formula to estimate the opening angle of a planet within the context of JWST (Wardenier) and the first full K2 transiting exoplanet sample (Zink). In planetary science, Dick discusses protein synthesis as an energy-releasing process in seawater-hydrothermal fluid mixtures. Happy reading !"

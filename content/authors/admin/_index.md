I am a PhD candidate in astrophysics at the Université de Montréal’s physics department. My research interests include statistical physics of complex systems, major evolutionary transitions and the origin of life. I am a member of the [Centre for Research in Astrophysics of Quebec (CRAQ)](http://craq-astro.ca/?lang=en) and the [Origin of Life Early-career Network](https://oolen.org/). I also maintain a [digest](research-digest/) of papers published related to the origin of life.

In my free time, I run, bike, do yoga, code some more, and then read a bit more too. I also love to travel. Sometimes I sleep.

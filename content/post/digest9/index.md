title: OoL digest — edition 9
subtitle: In today’s digest, we have astrobiology papers about the formation of amino acids in meteorites and machine learning techniques as a classification tool for the biogenicity of molecular patterns. Moreover, in biochemistry we have a paper discussing HGT and its implications for LUCA, and another one on segregation. Finally, in planetary science we have two papers about planetary formation’s effect on habitability, and another one on Earth’s primitive atmosphere.
